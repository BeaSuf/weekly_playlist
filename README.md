## 1. IDEA:


During th week the office workers search, add and vote for their favorite songs to be included at the weekly playlist.

Workers can vote only for songs that other workers added for the current week.

The votes are anonimus.
 
On Friday, Admin creates new playlist and selects the most voted songs for this week's playlist.

The playlist can be then played at the office's happy hour.

## 2. DEVELOPMENT

###   Technologies Used:

+ Client - Server archetecture
+ Html
+ CSS
+ Ruby for server programing
+ PostgreSQL
+ deezer API 

### Planning:

I've crated a Trello bord and broken down all the requrements and nice to have features, made a rough sketch of how my app would look. This process allowed me to visually map out all of the features that would require implementing and styling.


### Data modeling:

I've created the data modeling of the application, the required tables and relations. 

### Code: 

This process was based on the code planning stage and following the tasks in Trello, I"ve implemented feature by feature to a workin condition.  


### Styling:

I've implemented the basic layout and styling and gradualy added additional styling as time allowed.
